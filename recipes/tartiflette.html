      <li>
        Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a
        boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20
        minutes. Drain and cool until easily handled. Peel and slice potatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook onions until soft
        and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes and bacon, cover, and
        simmer over medium-low heat for 15 minutes. Add wine, salt, and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.
